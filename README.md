# Active Directory Penetration Testing Lab

A vulnerable AD lab environment for practicing CPTS-style penetration testing techniques. This lab includes multiple attack vectors and privilege escalation paths commonly found in real-world assessments.

## 📁 Repository Contents

### `Setup.ps1`
PowerShell script that automatically deploys a vulnerable Active Directory environment on your domain controller. It creates:
- Vulnerable web application with SQL injection and file upload flaws
- Multiple user accounts with weak configurations (AS-REP roasting, Kerberoasting)
- Misconfigured permissions (DCSync rights, constrained delegation)
- GPP passwords in SYSVOL
- Several privilege escalation vectors
- Intentionally weakened security settings

**The script is fully dynamic** - it adapts to any domain name and automatically configures everything.

### `challenge-guide.html`
Interactive challenge worksheet with 10 progressively difficult tasks covering the full attack chain from initial foothold to domain compromise. Includes:
- Points system (1000 total points)
- Built-in hints for each challenge
- Answer validation
- Progress tracking

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Windows Server with Active Directory Domain Services installed
- Domain Controller role configured
- PowerShell 5.1+ with ActiveDirectory module
- Domain Admin privileges

### Lab Deployment

1. **Download the script** to your Domain Controller

2. **Run as Administrator**:
   ```powershell
   .\CPTS-Lab-Setup.ps1
   ```

3. **Reboot the DC** (required for LDAP signing changes):
   ```powershell
   Restart-Computer -Force
   ```

4. **Access the web application**:
   - `http://DC-HOSTNAME/portal`
   - Guest credentials: `guest / guest123`

### Using the Challenge Guide

1. **Open the HTML file** in any browser:
   ```bash
   # Just double-click the file, or:
   firefox challenge-guide.html
   # or
   chrome challenge-guide.html
   ```

2. **Work through challenges** in order (they build on each other)

3. **Use hints** if you get stuck - each challenge has a hint button

4. **Submit answers** to track your progress and score

## 🎯 Attack Paths Overview

The lab includes multiple routes to domain compromise:

- **Path 1**: Web app → Backup config leak → AS-REP roasting → Lateral movement
- **Path 2**: GPP password → Instant Domain Admin
- **Path 3**: Kerberoasting → Nested group abuse → Domain Admin
- **Path 4**: DCSync rights abuse
- **Path 5**: Constrained delegation exploitation

## 🧹 Cleanup

To remove all vulnerable configurations:

```powershell
.\CPTS-Lab-Setup.ps1 -Cleanup
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **For lab environments only** - never deploy in production
- Script requires Domain Admin privileges
- All configurations are intentionally insecure
- Perfect for OSCP/CPTS/CRTP practice

## 🛠️ Tools You'll Need

- Impacket suite (GetNPUsers, GetUserSPNs, secretsdump, psexec)
- Hashcat or John the Ripper
- Nmap
- Optional: BloodHound, PowerView, CrackMapExec
